I work with data to answer business questions.  This blog is created to record my learnings around statistics and data science.

I studied undergraduate mathematics and commerce in Brisbane; worked with one of the big consulting firms for a few years in various cities of Australia / Europe (Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Amsterdam, Brussels which was certainly fun) but decided to give it in to travel South America for a year.  I then undertook a PhD in applied statistics thinking I would work in the field but realised that it would be hard to maintain steady (non-contractual) employment. After a year working as a lecturer of Statistics in Colombia (using my backpacker-learnt Spanish) I then worked in simulation modelling where we started applying design of experiments and machine learning to the simulation model output and I decided to switch to analytics on a full-time basis.  

I now work for an insurance company, doing a fair bit of ad-hoc analysis and reporting; although I am getting more and more opportunity to create predictive models which is  motivating me to up my skills at a much quicker pace.  Hence this blog as a way to record my learning journey so that I can refer to my notes wherever I am (rather than having them scattered all over the place).
