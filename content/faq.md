I work with data to answer business questions.  My current title is "data scientist" which I don't yet feel comfortable using as I am a long way off from knowing the ins and outs of the vast number of algorithms, languages, etc.  So this blog is created to record my learnings to warrant the title.

I studied undergraduate mathematics and commerce in Brisbane; worked with one of the big consulting firms for a few years in various cities of Australia / Europe (Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Amsterday, Brussels which was certainly fun) but decided to give it in to travel South America for a year.  I then undertook a PhD in applied statistics thinking I would work in the field but realised that it would be hard to maintain steady (non-contractual) employment and that the pay would be a lot lower ... After a year working as a lecturer of Statistics in Colombia (poor students as I took the role expecting that I would teach in English only to realise that I would be using my backpacker-learnt Spanish) I then worked in simulation modelling where we started applying design of experiments and machine learning to the simulation model output and I decided to switch to analytics on a full-time basis.  

I now work for an insurance company, doing a fair bit of ad-hoc analysis and reporting; although I am getting more and more opportunity to create predictive models which is also motivating me to up my skills at a much quicker pace.  Not so easy with a 3 year old that loves attention.

Other than work, I spend my time with my family (we played snap about 50 times on the weekend), camping, latin-dancing and doing art / craft (e.g. pattern-making / sewing).
